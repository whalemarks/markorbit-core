## Package areas

- `packages/core-types` — future canonical TypeScript types.

- `packages/core-validation` — future validation schemas and rules.
- `packages/core-fixtures` — future specification fixtures.
- `packages/core-events` — future event primitives and catalog.

## Validation expectations

Every change should keep the TypeScript project buildable, tests passing, lint checks clean, and repository diffs free of whitespace errors.

## Next tasks

- CORE-TASK-003 — Core Object Base Types.
- Add base Core primitives in the order defined by the roadmap.
